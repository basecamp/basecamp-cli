You have access to `bcq` CLI for Basecamp operations.
This allows you to manage todos, projects, messages, and more directly from your chat.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `bcq search "query"` to find relevant context before acting.
- When creating todos, check for existing lists first using `bcq todolists`.
- Use JSON output (`--json`) when you need to parse results programmatically.
